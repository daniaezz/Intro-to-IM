# Final Idea


Our project is going to be a cooking game where you perform the actions and they’ll be reflected on screen. We’re going to give the user an option to choose between 3 different meals (burger, salad, smoothie). We are planning to use a glove connected to multiple sensors that will allow the user to cook these meals. The user will be given a score depending on how well they cook the meal!

**Burger**

- First, the user will need to turn on the stove, we are planning to simulate this using a potentiometer
- The user will be able to flip the burger by moving their hands up and down, we will use an accelerometer to detect this movement and it will be reflected on the screen using p5.js. They should be aware to not burn the burger as this will reduce the score
- They have the option to add vegetables, such as tomatoes and lettuce. They would need to cut these vegetables using a physical (plastic) knife on a cutting board. The cutting motion will be detected using the accelerometer
- Then they can “grab” these vegetables and add them onto the burger. This motion will be detected using computer vision

**Salad**

 - The user will be able to cut vegetables using the knife and cutting board.
 - The veggies can be dragged onto the cutting board from a shelf, this will be detected using computer vision
 - Cutting the veggies for too long will result in a liquid salad and the reduction of the score
 - Lifting the cutting board will drop the vegetable into a bowl. This will be displayed on p5.js 
 - The user will also be able to add dressing to a salad by squeezing a bottle 


**Smoothie**
- The user will cut the fruits, we are entertaining the possibility of using a fruit scent that will blow as they do this
- Similar to the mechanics used in the salad, the fruits will drop into the blender as they lift the cutting board
- They will be able to turn on the blender using a potentiometer, blending the smoothie for too long will turn it into a yogurt and the score will be reduced 
- The user can also take a small drink umbrella, the umbrella will have a thank you note on it and taking it will automatically add one to the drink on p5.js
