# Midterm project
---
### Sunday 27 Feb update
I have finalized the story for the game I will be making. The story will have the user as a character that woke up to find themselves turning into a chicken. To turn back into a human, the chicken boy seeks help from a witch but the witch has a condition, the chicken must find the witchâ€™s cat. 
To stop themselves from turning into a chicken forever, they must collect human items such as books. And if they collect items like eggs they lose human points. The user should collect these times before time runs out or the game will be lost. 
 
The sprites I will be using in this project are made by 9E0 on itch.io and the font for text will be Press Start 2P from fonts.google.com

For now, I have started by importing the assets and loading them into the sketch. this includes loading the sprites and running them as well as testing out that the font works.
