#self portrait
___


the idea behind this piece was a plant-based face portrait. This idea was inspired by the plants I have in my room which I thought portrayed a unique part of myself. I first started by sketching the idea in where the eyes were flowers, and the eyelashes were the petals. This was later achieved by using different ellipses. The idea for the face was to be a vein that ends with a leaf (the mouth). The idea for the hair was meant to have the hair as veins however this idea was later scrapped and replaced with a flower crown to achieve a more abstract look which would better complement the rest of the portrait. Most of the portrait was created using ellipses and the function curveVertex. The eyes and flowers were created using different ellipses and the nose and leaves were created using curveVertex. Additional details were added using the line function. I found no need to use the rect or triangle function in this project. For the colour scheme I tried to follow a kind of pastel colour scheme rather than harsher colour tones to make the portrait feel softer on the eyes.
