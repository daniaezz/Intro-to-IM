# For Loops
---

For this assignment, I struggled to come up with an idea, so I started to look for inspiration in the art magazines. I was mainly intrigued by this piece (attached below) which uses empty squares to create a simple yet aesthetic artwork. I decided to attempt to recreate this piece using p5.js. For this algorithm I used a nested `for loop`, one that iterates for the `width` and one that iterates for the `height`. I drew the rectangle using the `for-loop` variables for the width and height, so they change with each iteration. I used `random` for the size of the rectangle as well as for the x and y coordinates, so they appear to be a little more natural. Before this exercise I was a little confused by the syntax of the for loop in p5.js but I feel more confident about it now. I also had some trouble figuring out how to iterate the rows and columns but this exercise helped me understand how to do that. Overall I am satisfied with the outcome of this generative art work as it turned out to be similiar to what I wanted to recreate.
