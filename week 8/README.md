# Creative Switch
For this project I looked in my surroundings for things that can conduct electricity. The only thing that I could find at the time was water. I experimented with trying to make the LED light up through water and found that water alone wasnâ€™t enough to make the switch light up brightly. I added salt to the water and it turned out perfect. After that I was trying to think of an action that could be done with water that would allow the circuit to be complete. That's when i remembered my plant, that i forgot to water. Conveniently, the soil in the plant was also a conductor. When I connected the circuit to just the soil using 3.3V, nothing happened but when I connected it to the 5V, the bulb lit up only a little and wasn't noticeable at all. However when I added water to the soil, the bulb lit up a little more. I experimented with different salt levels and found that 1 packet of salt wasn't enough to make the bulb light up to the level I wanted. I added 2 packets of salt to a small amount of water to make a saturated solution. When I added this solution to the plant, the bulb lit up strongly, the more water I added the more the bulb lit up. It stayed lit for almost 5 to 10 minutes before the light dimmed but it was still considerably brighter than before I watered it. Overall I am very satisfied with how this project turned out.
